A negative number is specified as "-1298".
No space between minus sign and number. If there is a space then it is
considered as a subtraction operator

BigNum.java  - source code
input.txt    - input file - There should be a space between each operand and operation including brackets
run.sh       - This script executes the code and stores the output in output.txt file. Then it executes
               unix "bc" utility and stores its output in outputBc.txt. Finally it compares both the 
               output files using "diff" command.
Note:
For square root this project uses "number r 2" format. BC tool uses sqrt(number)
